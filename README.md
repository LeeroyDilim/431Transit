### Introduction

Welcome to my first mobile app, 431Transit. It is my approach on a modern and user-friendly transit app. This app was made with Android Studio, and used Gradle and Retrofit to communicate with the Winnipeg Transit API and Google Static Maps API and render their responses.

One notable thing about this project is that starting off, I did not know a single thing about mobile app development, interacting with external APIs, and initializing/managing a client side database. But I was able to learn these concepts and create a working version of the app within a span of two weeks, displaying my excellent ability to learn efficiently and effectively.

Two things that were most challenging about this project was getting started, and designing a transit app that was both modern, user-friendly and intuitive. As a newcomer to UX design, crafting a modern and user-friendly app was a challenge. To overcome this, I researched successful apps, studying popular social media and transit apps. By analyzing their designs, I identified what made them user-friendly and modern. Implementing these principles, I shaped 431Transit to ensure a positive and intuitive user experience.

In essence, my approach was to learn by doing and draw inspiration from proven designs. This resulted in a journey of growth and adaptation, turning challenges into opportunities for innovation.
